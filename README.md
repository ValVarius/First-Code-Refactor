# First-Code-Refactor
The first thing I did  is fixing the non functioning link on line 16 of the original HTML doc, Link indicated a reference to a class and not an id. Additionally I included a minimum width in the body so to keep the elements from squeezing together when the restoring down the page.  Aside from this, I added some more coherent spacing in the HTML doc so to make it more readable. I then proceeded to add alt attributes to each image element as they were missing. The main image in the page was confusingly, and ironically, a background of a div that has no other elements. I placed the link in the div itself and styled it by using and id. 
Many of the changes occurred on the CSS code, where most of the elements where redundantly assigned the same property-value pairs. By collecting these values under the same selector I simplified the code considerably. In doing so I decided to eliminate many of the classes and utilize the most appropriate semantic elements. This rendered both files much more intellegible.
